				<b>Let me introduce</b> this with an important preface. I do not think the Seahawks will trade Russell Wilson. 
				I do not think they should trade Russell Wilson. Priority No. 1 for the team should be winning games.
				Priority No. 2 should be keeping its star quarterback around for as long as possible, because that
				gives the team the best chance of fulfilling Priority No. 1.I don't think the relationship between
				Wilson and the Seahawks has soured to the same extent that Deshaun Watson's has with the Texans or
				Carson Wentz's did with the Eagles, but if it came down to picking between the two, I'd choose 
				Wilson over Pete Carroll in about two seconds.
